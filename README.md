# TAMUhack2023
I had the great fortune to contribute greatly to two team projects for TAMUhack 2023. I intend to develop both projects in my own ways in the near future. I have attached a file which explains in great detail, the logic and resoning behind Binary vs. Quantum thinking.

Our Grand Casino is a program which simulates an actual casino in which you are allowed to chose between playing Blackjack and the Slotmachine. In this program we make use of the randomizer function in C++ for both Blackjack and Slotmachine. We also make use of a minimum balance tracker in order to simulate the actual situation in a casino (minimum to continue playing is $20). It is also possible to switch between the two games.
